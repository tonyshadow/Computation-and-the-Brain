# Computation-and-the-Brain
 Project for Computation and the Brain Course

This project is based on paper: Dasgupta, Sanjoy, Charles F. Stevens, and Saket Navlakha. "A neural algorithm for a fundamental computing problem." Science 358.6364 (2017): 793-796.

In this project, we developed a Fly inspired Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) and a traditional LSH function, and evaluted their performance on three different datasets (SIFT, GLOVE, and MNIST).
